<h3>What Happened to Monday</h3>
<p>Provides a gripping and dystopian view of a future where overpopulation and strict family-size regulations lead to dire consequences, making it a standout film for its intense storyline and thrilling twists.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Masterfully combines stunning visuals, a deeply emotional narrative, and scientifically grounded exploration themes that push the boundaries of space, time, and human potential.</p>

<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>Really interesting sci-fi movie that has a plot that seems eerily realistic and thought-provoking, delving into the implications of artificial intelligence and its impact on human identity and ethics.</p>
